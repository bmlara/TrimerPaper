  abstract = {We describe a mechanism for a controlled generation of a pure Bell

	The mechanism inhibits transitions into singly excited collective
	states of a two-atom system by shifting them from their unperturbed
	energies. The shift is accomplished by the dipole-dipole interaction
	between the atoms. The creation of the Bell state is found to be
	dependent on the relaxation of the atomic excitation. When the relaxation
	is not present or can be ignored, the state of the system evolves
	harmonically between a separable to the maximally entangled state.We
	follow the temporal evolution of the state and find that the concurrence
	can be different from zero only in the presence of the dipole-dipole
	interaction. Furthermore, in the limit of a large dipole-dipole interaction,
	the concurrence reduces to that predicted for an X state of the system.
	A general inequality is found which shows that the concurrence of
	an X-state system is a lower bound for the concurrence of the two-atom
	system. With the relaxation present, the general state of the system
	is a mixed state that under a strong dipole-dipole interaction reduces
	the system to an X-state form. We find that mixed states admit of
	lower level of entanglement, and the entanglement may occur over
	a finite range of time. A simple analytical expression is obtained

	value for the dipole-dipole interaction relative to the Rabi frequency

  abstract = {We have studied quantum mechanically a system of several small identical

	This system is analogous to a collection of identical atoms in a
	cavity, which is described under appropriate conditions by the Dicke
	model. We find that our system can be well approximated by a reduced
	Hamiltonian consisting of two levels per junction. The reduced Hamiltonian
	is similar to the Dicke Hamiltonian, but contains an additional term
	resembling a dipole-dipole interaction between the junctions. This
	extra term can Â¨ be understood as a natural consequence of degenerate
	second-order Lowdin perturbation theory. For typical, physically
	reasonable values of the junction-cavity coupling, we find that this
	perturbation treatment is an adequate way to include the junction
	energy levels beyond the lowest two. As in the Dicke model, we find
	that, when N junctions are present in the cavity, the junction-cavity
	interaction is enhanced by Í±N, with a corresponding decrease in
	the Rabi oscillation period. We find that this enhancement survives
	even if the junctions differ slightly from one another, as expected
	in a realistic system. Since coherence effects thus reduce the Rabi
	period, it may become smaller than the decoherence time due to dissipation,
	making these oscillations observable. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.65.224512

	In a previous paper,1 we numerically studied a small Josephson junction
	capacitively coupled to the single mode of a resonant cavity. We
	found that the quantum states of the combined system are strongly
	entangled only at certain special values of the gate voltage across
	the junction, corresponding to a one- or two-photon absorption or
	emission process by the junction Cooper pairs. We also showed that
	at a gate voltage corresponding to the one-photon process, our results,
	obtained from exact diagonalization, agree well with those obtained
	from a reduced Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian2 which includes only two-junction
	states and two-photon states. In the present paper, we extend this
	work to several similar junctions placed in a resonant cavity within
	a radiation wavelength. Each junction is assumed to be voltage biased
	by an independent voltage source, but all bias voltages are assumed
	to be equal. As in the single-junction case, we solve for the eigenstates
	of this coupled system by direct diagonalization and compare the
	results to those obtained from a reduced Hamiltonian which includes
	only two energy levels per junction. A major goal of our work is
	to compare the junctioncavity interaction to that in a system first
	discussed by Dicke,3 consisting of an assembly of identical two-level
	atoms in a single-mode cavity. We find that, for typical values of
	our system parameters, the effects of the energy levels beyond the
	lowest two per junction are included adequately by a straightforward
	second-order perturbation theory. These higher-level effects manifest
	themselves as an additional effective interaction between the junctions
	beyond the Dicke Hamiltonian which has the form of a dipole-dipole
	coupling. Before proceeding further, we note some distinctions between
	the system considered here and another system which},

	time close to nonlinear resonances occurring in the classical counterpart.
	Our mathematical formalism for the recurrence time scales is presented
	as delicate recurrences, which take place, for instance, when the
	lattice is perturbed weakly and robust recurrences, which may manifest
	themselves for a sufﬁciently strong external driving force. The analysis
	not only is valid for a dilute condensate, but also is applicable
	for the strongly interacting homogeneous condensate provided; the
	external modulation causes no signiﬁcant change in the density proﬁle
	of the condensate. We explain the parametric dependence of the dynamical
	recurrence times, which can easily be realized in laboratory experiments.
	In addition, we ﬁnd good agreement between the obtained analytical

	waves. These nonparaxial waves propagate along parabolic trajectories

	is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive
	interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction.
	The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model.
	The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination
	of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited
	in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the
	normal state by amount proportional to an average $(\hbar \omega)^2$,

	excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal
	phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states

	configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition
	and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated

	However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many
	particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely
	unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating
	an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using
	a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit
	gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative
	processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system
	dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states,
	the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum
	non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding
	controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel

  abstract = {The Hamiltonian H specifies the energy levels and time evolution of
	a quantum theory. A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires
	that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy
	spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving).
	This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics
	in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose +complex
	conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of
	space–time reflection ( \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} ) symmetry. If H has
	an unbroken \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} symmetry, then the spectrum is
	real. Examples of \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric non-Hermitian
	quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=\hat{p}^2+\rmi\hat{x}^3 and
	H=\hat{p}^2-\hat{x}^4 . Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians
	are all real and positive!
	
	
	Does a \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric Hamiltonian H specify a physical
	quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time
	evolution is unitary? The answer is that if H has an unbroken \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}
	symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator
	\mathcal{C} . In terms of \mathcal{C} , one can construct a time-independent
	inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}
	-symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories
	having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution.
	
	
	The Lee model provides an excellent example of a \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}
	-symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has
	a negative-norm 'ghost' state because renormalization causes the
	Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there
	have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the
	ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of
	the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian
	is \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} -symmetric. The \mathcal{C} operator for
	the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost
	is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas
	of \mathcal{P}\mathcal{T} symmetry are illustrated by using many
	quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.},

	decay . Over a longer time scale, revivals and collapses in the field
	populations take place . The time scales of these phenomena are much
	larger than those of the atomic Rabi oscillations decay . Moreover,
	the system attains a highly non-classical regime in which the field
	intensity in each mode is subjected to strong fluctuations even for
	a large initial number of photons in the coherent mode. Various correlations
	between atomic and field dynamics are pointed out, and the physical

	cavity to confine the field, the strength of this interaction can
	be increased by many orders of magnitude, to a point where it dominates
	over any dissipative process. This strong-coupling regime of cavity
	quantum electrodynamics1,2 has been reached for real atoms in optical
	cavities3 , and for artificial atoms in circuit quantum electrodynamics4
	and quantum dot systems5,6 . A signature of strong coupling is the
	splitting of the cavity transmission peak into a pair of resolvable
	peaks when a single resonant atom is placed inside the cavity, an
	effect known as vacuum Rabi splitting. The circuit quantum electrodynamics
	architecture is ideally suited for going beyond this linear-response
	effect. Here, we show that increasing the drive power results in
	two unique nonlinear features in the transmitted heterodyne signal:
	the supersplitting of each vacuum Rabi peak into a doublet and the
	â appearance of extra peaks with the characteristic n spacing of
	the Jaynes-Cummings ladder. These findings constitute direct evidence
	for the coupling between the quantized microwave field and the anharmonic
	spectrum of a superconducting qubit acting as an artificial atom.},

	by the field on the wave function of nonresonant atoms crossing the
	cavity. This shift can be measired by atomic interferometry, using
	the Ramsey separated-oscillatory-field method. The information acquired
	by detecting a sequence of atoms modifies the field step by step,
	until it eventually collpses into a Fock state. At the same time,
	the field phase undergoes a diffusive process as a result of the

	Once a Fock state has been generated, its evolution under weak perturbation

	steps of the measuring sequence produce quantum superpositions of

	fully quantized interaction between two quantum systems of different
	nature: a two-level atom (fermionic system) and a quantized field
	mode (bosonic system). This interaction leads to extreme quantum
	entanglement of the atom and field. However, the model also predicts
	that, at precisely half of the revival time, the atom and field become
	asymptotically disentangled. This disentanglement becomes more exact

	the nature of the pure-field-state superposition generated at such

	of the field with the same amplitude but opposite phase. Interference
	between these components leads to nonclassical oscillations in photon-number
	distributions and squeezing in quadratures of the field. The Schrodinger-cat

	been predicted recently. Due to the long-range nature of the cavity-mediated
	interactions, but also the presence of a driving laser and dissipative
	processes such as cavity photon loss, the quantum optical realization
	of glassy physics has no analog in condensed matter and could evolve
	into a “cavity glass microscope” for frustrated quantum systems out
	of equilibrium. Here we develop the nonequilibrium theory of the
	multimode Dicke model with quenched disorder and Markovian dissipation.
	Using a unified Keldysh path integral approach, we show that the
	defining features of a low-temperature glass, representing a critical
	phase of matter with
	
	algebraically decaying temporal correlation functions, are seen to
	be robust against the presence of dissipation due to cavity loss.
	The universality class, however, is modified due to theMarkovian
	bath. The presence of strong disorder leads to an enhanced equilibration
	of atomic and photonic degrees of freedom, including the emergence
	of a common low-frequency effective temperature. The imprint of the
	atomic spin-glass physics onto the photon subsystem realizes a “photon
	glass” state and makes it possible to detect the glass state by standard
	experimental techniques of quantum optics.We provide an unambiguous
	characterization of the superradiant and glassy phases in terms of
	fluorescence spectroscopy, homodyne detection, and the temporal photon

	large angular momentum, this system will behave like a standard cavity-QED

	would benefit from an accurate analytical model of Gaussian beam
	propagation. We present a full vector analysis of Gaussian beam propagation
	by using the well-known method of the angular spectrum of plane waves.
	A Gaussian beam is assumed to traverse a charge-free, homogeneous,
	isotropic, linear, and nonmagnetic dielectric medium. The angular
	spectrum representation, in its vector form, is applied to a problem
	with a Gaussian intensity boundary condition. After some mathematical
	manipulation, each nonzero propagating electric field component is
	expressed in terms of a power-series expansion. Previous analytical
	work derived a power series for the transverse field, where the first
	term (zero order) in the expansion corresponds to the usual scalar
	paraxial approximation. We confirm this result and derive a corresponding
	longitudinal power series. We show that the leading longitudinal
	term is comparable in magnitude with the first transverse term above
	the scalar paraxial term, thus indicating that a full vector theory
	is required when going beyond the scalar paraxial approximation.
	In spite of the advantages of a compact analytical formalism, enabling
	rapid and accurate modeling of Gaussian beam systems, this approach
	has a notable drawback. The higher-order terms diverge at locations
	that are sufficiently far from the initial boundary, yielding unphysical
	results. Hence any meaningful use of the expansion approach calls
	for a careful study of its range of applicability. By considering
	the transition of a Gaussian wave from the paraxial to the spherical
	regime, we are able to derive a simple expression for the range within
	which the series produce numerically satisfying answers. Â© 2002

  abstract = {Superconducting circuits are macroscopic in size but have generic
	quantum properties such as quantized energy levels, superposition
	of states, and entanglement, all of which are more commonly associated
	with atoms. Superconducting quantum bits (qubits) form the key component
	of these circuits. Their quantum state is manipulated by using electromagnetic
	pulses to control the magnetic flux, the electric charge or the phase
	difference across a Josephson junction (a device with nonlinear inductance
	and no energy dissipation). As such, superconducting qubits are not
	only of considerable fundamental interest but also might ultimately
	form the primitive building blocks of quantum computers. The theory
	of quantum mechanics was originally developed to account for the
	observed behaviour of electrons in atoms. More than 80 years later,
	it is being used to explain the behaviour of superconducting circuits
	that can be hundreds of nanometres wide and can contain trillions
	of electrons. The quantum nature of these circuits is observable
	because they can be engineered to be isolated from the electrical
	environment and are thus represented by a single degree of freedom.
	Significant coupling to other degrees of freedom causes rapid decoherence,
	destroying the quantum state of the circuit so that it behaves classically.
	Unlike atoms, these circuits can be designed and constructed to tailor
	their characteristic frequencies, as well as other parameters. These
	frequencies can be controlled by adjusting an external parameter,
	and the coupling energy between two quantum bits (qubits) can be
	turned on and off at will. Superconducting quantum circuits are the
	subject of intense research at present, in part because they have
	opened up a new area of fundamental science and in part because of
	their long-term potential for quantum computing. In this review,
	we begin with a brief discussion of superconductivity and two of
	the superconducting properties that underlie how qubits operate:
	flux quantization and Josephson tunnelling. The three fundamental
	types of superconducting qubit - flux, charge and phase - are then
	described. This is followed by a review of the real-time, quantum-coherent
	dynamics of qubits and the limitations imposed by relaxation and
	decoherence, as well as the mechanisms of decoherence. We then discuss
	schemes for controlling the coupling between two qubits, a feature
	that greatly simplifies the implementation of proposed quantum-computing
	architectures. And we finish by discussing quantum optics on a chip,
	a new research direction in which the electromagnetic fields associated
	with control and read-out signals are treated quantum mechanically.},

  abstract = {In this age of alternative energy, solar power is one of the main
	contenders for providing us with clean energy. In photosynthesis,
	the energy of solar photons is transformed into chemical energy.
	In solar cells, they generate electrical energy. Solar energy can
	also be used directly to produce heat and drive a generator, such
	as in solar furnaces. The thus acquired energy can be used for a
	myriad of purposes, including refrigeration [1]. In this Letter,
	we propose a simple solid state device that uses photons to perform
	the task of refrigeration directly, bypassing the need to first generate
	another form of energy. The hope is that such a cooling mechanism
	will be more efficient, by avoiding some of the losses that always
	accompany the transformation between different forms of energy. The
	fact that solar radiation, which has a temperature of about 5800
	K, can be directly used to refrigerate may at first be surprising.
	The phenomenon itself is not novel, the most notable example being
	probably evaporative cooling (including ''sweating''); see, also,
	the optomechanical device recently proposed in [2]. Our device however
	is of an entirely different nature. It has the advantage of being
	a nanosized solid state device, with no moving parts, and no net
	electric currents, even though the cooling is the result of replacing
	''hot'' electrons by ''cold'' electrons. This feature suggests that
	the construction could also be used in nano low temperature physics,
	where a cold black body radiation (for example from liquid helium)
	could be used as photonic input to reach much lower temperatures
	in an electronic nanosetting. Before turning to a quantitative analysis
	of the refrigerator, we explain its mode of operation. The device,
	which is schematically represented in Fig. 1, consists of two leads
	(or electron reservoirs), separated by two adjoining quantum dots,
	each with a lower and upper energy level. The basic idea is that
	under influence of the high temperature photons, cold electrons are
	pumped from the left to the right lead transversing through the junction
	of the lower energy levels of the quantum dots, while an equal amount
	of hot electrons are pumped the other way at the junction of the
	higher energy levels. The result is a net replacement of hot electrons
	by cold electrons in the right lead, implying its refrigeration.
	A qualitative explanation goes as follows. Consider first the distributions
	of electrons in the lead.},

	achieved in one dimension so far5. For systems of many atoms, the
	three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved7 in
	atomic BoseâEinstein condensates (BECs). Although experiments combining
	BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently8,9, coupling
	BECs to cavities that are in the strong-coupling regime for single
	atoms has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment,
	made possible by combining a fibre-based cavity10 with atom-chip
	technology11. This enables single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics
	experiments with a simplified set-up and realizes the situation of
	many atoms in a cavity, each of which is identically and strongly
	coupled to the cavity mode12. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned
	deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely
	within a single antinode of the standing- wave cavity field; we demonstrate
	that this gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate.Westudy

	detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as
	well as an unpredicted additional splitting, which we attribute to
	the atomic hyperfine structure. We anticipate that the system will
	be suitable as a lightâmatter quantum interface for quantum information13.},

	methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In
	this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric

	potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which
	include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator
	transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property
	of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant
	potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials
	as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral
	potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and
	multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation
	methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric
	quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry
	inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant
	potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for
	the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large
	N expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle
	in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric

	supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum
	mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion

	the field polarization for this system. The diamagnetic term, e A
	/2mc, which is of the same order of magnitude as the RWA terms, is
	taken into account exactly by slightly modifying the traditional
	approach to quantizing the electromagnetic field. In this way the
	physical effects of the diamagnetic term are absorbed into a new
	electromagnetic cavity mode frequency. An approximate expression
	for the combined system's energy eigenvalues is found up to third
	order in the ratio of one-half the atomic transition frequency to
	the mode frequency. This expression indicates that inclusion of the
	RWA terms adds a small "ripple" on top of the smoothly varying energy
	eigenvalues when they are plotted as a function of the atom-field
	coupling constant. The ripple is interpreted as "interference" between
	two displaced oscillator-field states that represents the unperturbed
	state. When the Fock states are used as the basis for expanding the
	wave function of this system,
	
	a formidable five-term recurrence relation results. However, expanding
	the wave function in terms of the displaced harmonic-oscillator basis
	results in a less formidable three-term recurrence relation for the
	quantum coefficients.},

  journal = {Phys. Rev. A},
  year = {1991},
  volume = {43},
  pages = {2430 - 2435},
  abstract = {The interaction of a nonrelativistic, "two-level" atom with a single-frequency,
	quantized electromagnetic field is usually analyzed in the dipole
	approximation by applying the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) to
	obtain the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). In this
	paper, it is shown that for a spin- —particle, at rest in a constant
	magnetic field and for a system that obeys
	
	the electric dipole b I =+1 selection rules, a choice of a perturbing
	field that consists of circularly polarized photons can make the
	RWA unnecessary for the solution of the quantum-electrodynamic (QED)
	problem. For these cases, the only approximation necessary to obtain
	an exact solution of the @EDproblem is to neglect the spontaneous
	emission of photons with a sense of polarization opposite that of
	the perturbing field. The matrix elements corresponding to these
	"virtual" processes are independent of the number of photons n in
	the applied field and become relatively small, cornpared with those
	that correspond to energy-conserving processes, as n becomes large.
	However, a two-level system that obeys the Am =0 selection rule will
	require the RWA in order to reduce it to the JCM, regardless of the
	choice of polarization of the perturbing field. For this case, the
	emission
	
	of the photons that do not conserve energy is an induced process that
	corresponds to matrix elements that increase as &n + 1. It is thus
	concluded that, provided the right choice of selection rules and
	polarization of the applied field is made, the JCM provides a more
	accurate description of some systems than the accuracy of the RWA.
	Furthermore, it is concluded that an experimental test of the validity
	of the RWA can be made by performing the same experiments on an electric
	dipole Am =+1 transition, first with circularly polarized light and
	then with linearly polarized light of the same intensity. Any difference
	in response of the atomic system for these two experiments can be
	identified with terms that are neglected in the RWA. This experimental
	technique may prove useful for observing the optical Bloch-Siegert
	shift and for investigating the failure of the RWA and the chaotic
	quantum behavior predicted by Milonni, Ackerhalt, and Galbraith [Phys.

  abstract = {Electromagnetic and scalar fields are quantized in the region near
	an arbitrary smooth boundary, and the renormalized expectation value
	of the stress-energy tensor is calculated. The energy density is
	found to diverge as the boundary is approached. For nonconformally
	invariant fields it varies, to leading order, as the inverse fourth
	power of the distance from the boundary. For conformally invariant
	fields the coefficient of this leading term is zero, and the energy
	density varies as the inverse cube of the distance. An asymptotic
	series for the renormalized stress-energy tensor is developed as
	far as the inverse-square term in powers of the distance. Some criticisms
	are made of the usual approach to this problem, which is via the
	"renormalized mode sum energy, " a quantity which is generically
	infinite. Green's-function methods are used in explicit calculations,
	and an iterative scheme is set up to generate asymptotic series for
	Green's functions near a smooth boundary. Contact is made with the
	theory of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian
	operator. The method is extended to nonflat space-times and to an
	example with a nonsmooth boundary.},

	different parameters, such as the diffusion and mobility coefficients
	of carriers, surface recombination velocity, absorption coefficient
	of laser radiation, thickness of the slab and geometry of the cavity.
	We conclude that a significant amount (>103) of ‘Casimir photons’
	with a frequency of 2.5 GHz can be produced from vacuum in a cavity

	In the weak coupling regime1, the quantum dot radiative lifetime

	An alternative approach advocated here is to resort to a perturbative

	is reconstructed tomographically dependent on the type of polarization

	polarization patterns and the theory overlap by more than 90%. Moreover,
	we visualize the varying strengths of polarization entanglement for
	different transverse regions and demonstrate an interesting phenomenon:
	Each vector photon can be both entangled and not entangled in polarization
	with its partner photon. We give an intuitive, information-theoretical

	one is not. As n is turned on, the periodically varying relative
	position of the parabolic well with respect to the underlying lattice
	gives rise to the oscillating term for the energy eigenvalues. The
	time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is followed, and, in contrast
	with the continuum limit, its noncoherency is displayed. Damped oscillations
	of this wave packet occur between the spatial limits imposed by the
	parabolic well, or between those given by a Bloch oscillation. The
	"periods" for these two types of motion are quite different, and
	each depends on both the force a and on the spring constant of the
	oscillator. As time increases, Bloch osci11ations are eventually
	destroyed by the inhomogeneous restoring force of the harmonic oscillator,
	but not by the constant force field. Finally, we compare and contrast
	our results with the predictions of the semiclassical solid-state
	model, especially those involving effects due to Bloch oscillations.},

  abstract = {A theoretical perspective of high-order harmonic generation is presented
	in which transitions between Â¨ quantum Volkov states-stationary
	solutions to Schrodingerâs equation for an electron interacting
	with a quantized optical field-are the dominant mechanism for producing
	radiation. The picture proposed here is one in which the interaction
	of an intense optical field with an electron forms a photon-electron
	ââquasiatomââ and the stationary states of this complex can
	be viewed as the high optical field analog of bound states of an
	atom. Consequently, although momentum conservation for the overall
	harmonic generation process requires that an electron eventually
	return to the parent atom, the electron and fundamental optical field
	are treated as an isolated system with well-defined energy and momentum.
	To introduce a secondary photon harmonic field, the matrix element
	describing the electron-photon field interaction through quantum
	Volkov states is modified in a perturbative manner. The result is
	the production of harmonic photons by VolkovâVolkov-state transitions,
	a process which has no classical counterpart. The generation of odd
	harmonics of the fundamental field and the requirement that the final
	state of the electron be the initial bound state of the atom follow
	directly from the theory. A clear connection between harmonic generation
	and above-threshold ionization ATI is drawn by maintaining the discrete,
	nonzero energies of photoelectrons injected into the driving optical
	field by ATI. For experiments in which the laser pulse width is Õ¿100-150
	fs, only the lowest ATI photoelectron orders contribute significantly
	to harmonic generation, whereas higher-energy electrons escape from
	the parent atom during the pulse risetime. As the duration of the
	fundamental field is decreased, however, the rapid rise of the field
	intensity to its peak value effectively traps more energetic photoelectrons,
	thereby extending the harmonic response to shorter wavelengths. An
	analytic expression for the transition matrix for the harmonic generation
	process is derived and is compared with the predictions of semiclassical
	theory and published experimental results, including harmonic spectra
	and polarization data.},

  abstract = {We review both theoretical and experimental advances in the recently
	emerged field of modulated photonic lattices. These artificial periodic
	dielectric structures provide a powerful tool for the control of
	the fundamental aspects of light propagation. Photonic lattices are
	arrays of coupled optical waveguides, where the light propagation
	becomes effectively discretized. The discretized nature of light
	propagation gives rise to many new phenomena which are not possible
	in homogeneous bulk media, such as discrete diffraction and diffraction
	management, discrete and gap solitons, and discrete surface waves.
	Photonic lattices also allow one to realize optical analogies of
	phenomena occurring in other physical
	
	contexts, such as the physics of solid state and electron theory.
	For example, the light propagation in photonic lattices may resemble
	the motion of electrons in a crystalline lattice of semiconductor
	materials. Additionally, periodic modulation of a photonic lattice
	by varying its geometry or refractive index is analogous to applying
	a bias to control the motion of electrons in a crystalline lattice.
	An interplay between periodicity and modulation in photonic lattices
	opens up unique opportunities for tailoring diffraction and
	
	dispersion properties of light as well as controlling nonlinear interactions.
	First, we review the linear effects in the modulated waveguides and
	waveguide arrays, including optical Bloch oscillations and optical
	dynamic localization, that are key to the understanding of the modulation-driven
	diffraction management of light. Then we analyze the effects of array
	boundaries and defects, and highlight a new type of modulation-induced
	light localization based on the defect-free surface waves. Finally,
	we discuss nonlinear properties of the modulated lattices with an
	emphasis on their great potential for all-optical beam shaping and

	finitely many $ L_k$-submodules equivalent to $ M_{i_0}$ are supposed
	to occur in the decomposition of $ M$.
	
	A Harish-Chandra module is called indecomposable if it cannot be decomposed
	into the direct sum of $ L$-modules. In this paper the indecomposable
	Harish-Chandra modules over $ L$ are completely described. We find
	that there are two types of indecomposable Harish-Chandra modules.
	The modules of the first type are the non-singular Harish-Chandra
	modules and are defined by the following invariants: an integer $
	2l_0$ ($ l_0\geq0$), a complex number $ l_1$, and an integer $ n$.
	The first two of these invariants are already known as invariants
	of the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group (see [2]).
	The case of non-singular modules has been investigated earlier by
	Zhelobenko [3] from a somewhat different approach.
	
	The case of singular Harish-Chandra modules is of the greatest interest.
	The solution of this problem reduces to a non-trivial problem of
	linear algebra, which is investigated in detail in Chapter 2. The
	invariants of singular indecomposable modules are, as before, numbers
	$ l_0$, $ l_1$, $ l_0\ge0$, $ 2l_0$ integral and $ 2l_0-\vert l_1\vert$
	integral.
	
	However, instead of the one additional invariant $ n$, there are now
	more invariants. Two types of singular modules are possible: those
	of the first and those of the second kind.
	
	Singular modules of the first kind are characterized, in addition
	to the invariants $ l_0$ and $ l_1$, by a sequence of integers of
	arbitrary length. Singular indecomposable modules of the second kind
	are characterized by the following collection of invariants: the
	numbers $ l_0$, $ l_1$ given above, a set of integers $ j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_k$,
	an integer $ q$, and a further arbitrary complex parameter $ \mu$.
	The presence of this parameter is particularly interesting, because
	it indicates the possibility of deforming an indecomposable module
	with $ l_0$ and $ l_1$ fixed.
	
	The problems of linear algebra that are used in establishing the facts
	set out above are of independent interest in that the authors develop
	and use the apparatus of MacLane's theory of linear relations [4].},

	and “coset harmonics.” This operator is then used to construct fully
	symmetrized states describing N identical two-level atoms. The properties
	and quantum numbers of the symmetrized states are fully discussed.
	Fully symmetrized and labeled states for N identical 3 (or r) level
	atoms are constructed by a natural extension of this procedure.
	
	
	The interaction Hamiltonian, which describes transitions in an r-level
	atom, is constructed from the shift operators in the algebra of SU(r).
	When each of the N identical atoms “sees” the same field dependence,
	transitions are only allowed between energy eigenstates occurring
	within the same SU(r) unitary irreducible representation. Physical
	dispersion of the particles out of the coherence region of the field
	leads to “leakage” out of an SU(r) representation.
	
	
	If each two-level atom evolves from the ground state under the same
	field dependence, the total system state is a coherent superposition
	of bases belonging to the fully symmetric representation {N = 2J}2.
	These states exist in 1-1 correspondence with points in the surface
	of a unit sphere. They are therefore called Bloch states. The properties
	of Bloch states are derived and are seen to resemble the properties
	of coherent photon states. The connection is made manifest by a group
	contraction process. All properties of Glauber states can be constructed
	by contraction from the corresponding properties of the Bloch states.
	
	
	The states corresponding to N-identical r-level particles evolving
	under a coherent field are constructed in the same way. These states
	exist in 1-1 correspondence with points in the coset space , which
	is a Riemannian-symmetric space. The eigenstate expansions, inner
	products, eigenvalue equations, and uncertainty relations for these
	states are derived. More generally, systems of N identical (p + q)
	level atoms, evolving from the lowest q levels under a coherent field,
	are described by states existing in 1 - 1 correspondence with Riemannian
	symmetric space . The properties of these spaces are used to give
	a geometric analytic interpretation to these coherent atomic states.},

	quantum linear systems in which an uncontrollable and unobservable

	found that a realization is minimal if and only if it is Hurwitz
	stable. Computational methods are proposed to find the cardinality

	found that the transfer function G(s) of a quantum linear passive

  year = {2003},
  abstract = {In this thesis I report on experiments that enter a new regime in
	the many body physics of ultracold atomic gases. A Bose-Einstein
	condensate is loaded into a three-dimensional optical lattice potential
	formed by a standing wave laser light field. In this novel quantum
	system we have been able to both realize a quantum phase transition
	from a superfluid to a Mott insulator, and to observe the collapse
	and revival of a macroscopic matter wave field. Quantum phase transitions
	are driven by quantum fluctuations and occur, even at zero temperature,
	as the relative strength of two competing energy terms in the underlying
	Hamiltonian is varied across a critical value. In the first part
	of this work I report on the observation of such a quantum phase
	transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions,
	held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. In the superfluid
	ground state, each atom is spread-out over the entire lattice, whereas
	in the Mott insulating state, exact numbers of atoms are localized
	at individual lattice sites. We observed the reversible transition
	between those states and detected the gap in the excitation spectrum
	of the Mott insulator. A Bose-Einstein condensate is usually described
	by a macroscopic matter wave field. However, a quantized field underlies
	such a âclassicalâ matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate.
	The striking behavior of ultracold matter due to the field quantization
	and the nonlinear interactions between the atoms is the focus of
	the second part of this work. The matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein
	condensate is observed to undergo a series of collapses and revivals
	as time evolves. Furthermore, we show that the collisions between
	individual pairs of atoms lead to a fully coherent collisional phase
	shift in the corresponding many-particle state, which is a crucial
	cornerstone of proposed novel quantum computation schemes with neutral
	atoms. With these experiments we enter a new field of physics with
	ultracold quantum gases. In this strongly correlated regime, interactions
	between atoms dominate the behavior of the many-body system such
	that it can no longer be described by the usual theories for weakly
	interacting Bose gases. This novel quantum system offers the unique
	possibility to experimentally address fundamental questions of modern
	solid state physics, atomic physics, quantum optics, and quantum
	information.},

	properties, such as that in the Lamb-Dicke limit, the state evolves
	into a squeezed coherent state, and beyond the limit, the state can
	become a squeezed non-Gaussian state.},

	Via feeding broadband squeezed-vacuum light accompanying a coherent

	transfer of squeezing from the light to the movable mirror occurs,
	irrespective of the ratio between the cavity damping rate and the

  pages = {022325},
  abstract = {The role of retardation in the entanglement dynamics of two distant
	atoms interacting with a multimode field of a ring cavity is discussed.
	The retardation is associated with a finite time required for light
	to travel between the atoms located at a finite distance and between
	the atoms and the cavity boundaries. We explore features in the concurrence
	indicative of retardation and show how these features evolve depending
	on the initial state of the system, distance between the atoms, and
	the number of modes to which the atoms are coupled. In particular,
	we consider the short-time and the long-time dynamics for both the
	multi- and subwavelength distances between the atoms. It is found
	that the retardation effects can qualitatively modify the entanglement
	dynamics of the atoms not only at multi- but also at subwavelength
	distances. We follow the temporal evolution of the concurrence and

	periodic sudden changes of entanglement. To analyze where the entanglement
	lies in the space spanned by the state vectors of the system, we
	introduce the collective Dicke states of the atomic system that explicitly
	account for the sudden changes as a periodic excitation of the atomic
	system to the maximally entangled symmetric state. At long times,
	the retardation gives rise to periodic beats in the concurrence that
	resemble the phenomenon of collapses and revivals in the Jaynes-Cummings
	model. In addition, we identify parameter values and initial conditions
	at which the atoms remain separable or are entangled without retardation
	during the entire evolution time, but exhibit the phenomena of sudden
	birth and sudden death of entanglement when the retardation is included.},

	requires confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum-dot–cavity
	system in the strong-coupling regime. Here we find such confirmation
	by observing quantum correlations in photoluminescence from a photonic
	crystal nanocavity3, 4, 5 interacting with one, and only one, quantum
	dot located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. When
	off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and quantum-dot
	excitons is anticorrelated at the level of single quanta, proving
	that the mode is driven solely by the quantum dot despite an energy
	mismatch between cavity and excitons. When tuned to resonance, the
	exciton and cavity enter the strong-coupling regime of cavity QED
	and the quantum-dot exciton lifetime reduces by a factor of 145.
	The generated photon stream becomes antibunched, proving that the
	strongly coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum regime.
	Our observations unequivocally show that quantum information tasks
	are achievable in solid-state cavity QED.},

	waveguides is given. Issues raised in the debates of the 1980's on
	the merits and shortcomings of the conventional as well as the improved
	coupled-mode formulations are discussed. The conventional coupled-mode
	formulations are set up in a simple, intuitive way. The rigorous
	CMT is established on the basis of a linear superposition of the
	modes for individual waveguides. The cross-power terms appear logically
	as a result of modal nonorthogonality. The cross power is necessary
	for the self-consistency of the CMT for dissimilar waveguides. The
	nonorthogonal CMT, though more complicated, yields more-accurate
	results than the conventional orthogonal CMT for most practical applications.
	It also leads to the prediction of cross talk in directional couplers.
	The conventional orthogonal CMT is, however, reliably accurate for
	describing the power coupling between two weakly coupled, nearly
	identical waveguides. For dissimilar waveguides, a self-consistent
	orthogonal CMT can be derived by a redefinition of the coupling coefficients,
	and it predicts the coupling length and therefore the power exchange
	between the waveguides accurately if the two waveguides are far apart.
	Three typical coupler configurations-the uniform, the grating-assisted,
	and the tapered-are examined in detail. The accuracy, scope of validity,
	limitations, and extensions of the coupled-mode formulations are
	discussed in conjunction with each configuration. To verify the arguments
	in the discussions, comparisons with the exact analytical solutions

	oscillator. Such devices may allow the exploration of parameter regimes

	photons) by the Compton backscattering of twisted optical photons

	energy range have also been demonstrated experimentally; twisted
	protons and other particles can, in principle, be created in a similar

	important features. First, we treat the initial OAM state as a wave
	packet of a finite transverse size rather than a pure Bessel state.
	This realistic assumption allows us to resolve the existing controversy
	between two theoretical analyses for nonforward scattering. Second,
	we describe the final twisted particle in terms of the orbital helicity:
	the OAM projection on its average direction of propagation rather
	than on the fixed reaction axis. Using this formalism, we determine
	to what extent the twisted state is transferred from the initial
	to final OAM particle in a generic scattering kinematics. As a particular
	application, we prove that in the Compton backscattering the orbital
	helicity of the final photon stays close to the OAM projection of

	the early days of quantum mechanics. The problem is that the angle

	cos â¸ and sin â¸. In the case of the canonical pair â¸ , pâ¸,

	variables”, ϕ and I, is almost as old as quantum mechanics itself
	and since decades an intensively debated but still unresolved issue
	in quantum optics. The present paper proposes a new approach to the
	problem, namely quantization in terms of the group SO(1,2): The crucial
	point is that the phase space equation image has the global structure
	equation image (a simple cone) and cannot be quantized in the conventional
	manner. As the group SO(1,2) acts transitively, effectively and Hamilton-like
	on that space its irreducible unitary representations of the positive
	discrete series provide the appropriate quantum theoretical framework.
	The phase space equation image has the conic structure of an orbifold
	equation image. That structure is closely related to a Z2 gauge symmetry
	which corresponds to the center of a 2-fold covering of SO(1,2),
	the symplectic group equation image. The basic variables on the phase
	space are the functions h0 = I , h1 = I cos ϕ and h2 = -I sin ϕ the
	Poisson brackets of which obey the Lie algebra equation image. In
	the quantum theory they are represented by the self-adjoint Lie algebra
	generators K0, K1, and K2 of a unitary representation, where K0 has
	the spectrum {k + n, n = 0, 1, ...; k > 0}. A crucial prediction
	is that the classical Pythagorean relation h12 + h22 = h02 can be
	violated in the quantum theory. For each representation one can define
	three different types of coherent states the complex phases of which
	may be “measured” by means of the operators K1 and K2 alone without
	introducing any new phase operators! The SO(1,2) structure of optical
	squeezing and interference properties as well as that of the harmonic
	oscillator are analyzed in detail. The additional coherent states
	can be used for the introduction of (Husimi type) “Q” distributions
	and (Sudarshan-Glauber type) “P” representations of the density operator.
	The three operators K0, K1, and K2 are fundamental in the sense that
	one can construct composite position and momentum operators out of
	them! The new framework poses quite a number of fascinating experimental
	and theoretical challenges.},

  abstract = {By considering AdS5 Ã S 5 string states with large S 5 angular momenta
	one can provide non-trivial quantitative checks of the AdS/CFT duality.
	A string rotating in S 5 with two angular momenta J1 , J2 is dual
	to an operator in N = 4 SYM theory whose conformal dimension can
	be computed by diagonalizing a (generalization of) spin 1/2 Heisenberg
	chain Hamiltonian. It was recently argued and verified to lowest
	order in a large J = J1 + J2 expansion, that the Heisenberg chain
	can be described using a non-relativistic low energy effective 2d
	action for a unit vector field ni which exactly matches the corresponding
	large J limit of the classical AdS5 Ã S 5 string action. In this
	paper we show that this agreement extends to the next order and develop
	a systematic procedure for computing higher orders in such large
	angular momentum expansion. This involves several nontrivial steps.
	On the string side, we need to choose a special gauge with a non-diagonal
	world-sheet metric which insures that the angular momentum is uniformly
	distributed along the string, as indeed is the case on the spin chain
	side. We need also to implement an order by order redefinition of
	the field ni to get an action linear in the time derivative. On the
	spin chain side, it turns out to be crucial to include the effects
	of integrating out short wave-length modes. In this way we gain a
	better understanding of how (a subsector of) the string sigma model
	emerges from the dual gauge theory, allowing us to demonstrate the
	duality beyond comparing particular examples of states with large
	J .},

	(CHRW), which is a simple method based on a unitary transformation
	with a parameter ξ. This approach is beyond the traditional rotating-wave
	approximation (Rabi-RWA) and more importantly, remains the RWA form
	with a renormalized tunneling strength and a modified driving strength.
	The reformulated rotating-wave method not only possesses the same
	mathematical simplicity as the Rabi-RWA but also allows us to explore
	the effects of counter-rotating (CR) components. We focus on the
	properties of off-resonance cases for which the Rabi-RWA method breaks
	down. After comparing the results of different RWA schemes and those

	we show that the CHRW method gives the accurate driven dynamics which
	is in good agreement with the numerical method. Moreover, the other
	RWA methods appear as various limiting cases of the CHRW method.
	The CHRW method reveals the effects of the CR terms clearly by means
	of coherent destruction of tunneling and Bloch-Siegert shift. Our
	main results are as follows: (i) the dynamics of the coherent destruction
	of tunneling is explicitly given and its dependence on Δ is clarified,
	which is quantitatively in good agreement with the exact results;
	(ii) the CR modulated Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift
	are analytically calculated, which is the same as the exact results
	up to fourth order; (iii) the validity of parameter regions of different
	RWA methods are given and the comparison of dynamics of these methods
	are shown. Since the CHRW approach is mathematically simple as well
	as tractable and physically clear, it may be extended to some complicated
	problems where it is difficult to do a numerical study.},

	bases is p + 1 and, when this number is realized, all remaining (pN
	- p) bases in the complement are characterized by the total entanglement
	of every particle. This âstandard distributionâ is inescapable
	for two-particle systems (of any p), where only product and generalized
	Bell bases are admissible MUB types. This and the following results
	generalize previous results for qubits [Phys. Rev. A 65. 032320 (2002);
	Phys. Rev. A 72, 062310 (2005)] and qutrits [Phys. Rev. A 70, 012302
	(2004)], drawing particularly upon [Phys. Rev. A 72, 062310 (2005).].
	With three particles there are three MUB types, and these may be
	combined in (p + 2) different ways to form full complements. With
	N = 4, there are 6 MUB types for p = 2, but new MUB types become
	possible with larger p, and these are essential to realizing full
	complements.With this example, we argue that newMUB types that show
	new entanglement patterns should enter with every step in N and,
	also, when N is a prime plus 1, at a critical p value, p = N - 1.
	Such MUBs should play critical roles in filling complements.},

	of the latter problem; (3) the demonstration that there exists a
	simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in
	the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the error incurred in
	it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space these
	errors are either very small in the limit of interest to us (the
	``slow-tunneling'' limit) or can themselves be evaluated with satisfactory
	accuracy; (4) use of these results to obtain qunatitative expressions
	for the dynamics of the system as function of the spectral density
	J(w) of its coupling to the environment. If J(w) begaves as w^s for
	frequencies of the order of the tunneling frequency or smaller, the
	authors find for the ``unbiased'' case the following results: For
	s<1 the system is localized at zero temperature, and at finite T
	relaxes incoherently at a rate proportional to ex-(T0/T)^(1-s). For
	s>2 it undergoes underdamped coherent oscillations for all relevant
	temperatures, while for 1<s<2 there is a crossover from coherent
	oscillation to overdamped relaxation as T increases. Exact expressions
	for the oscillations and/or relaxation rates are presented in all
	these cases. For the ``ohmic'' case, s=1, the qualitative nature
	of the behavior depends critically on the dimensionless coupling
	strength a as well as the temperature T: over most of the (a, T)
	plane (including the whole region a>1) the behavior is an incoherent
	relaxation at a rate proportional to T^(2a -1), but for low T and
	0<a<1/2 the authors predict a combination of damped coherent oscillation
	and incoherent background which appears to disagree with the results
	of all previous approximations. The case of finite bias is also discussed.},

	orbital angular momentum. Expressions for the spin and orbital angular
	momentum are given in terms of the electric vector in reciprocal

	used to investigate the angular momentum of nonparaxial beams that

	and its frequency is tuned to be larger (or smaller) than those of
	other cavities, then there is a photon bound state above (or below)
	the energy band of the coupled-cavity array. However, if two cavities
	in the array have tunable frequencies, then there exist both bound
	states and resonant states. If the frequencies of the two cavities
	are chosen to be much larger than those of other cavities, and the
	hopping couplings between any two nearest-neighbor cavities are weak,
	then a single photon with a resonant wave vector can be trapped in
	the region between the two frequency-tunable cavities. In this case,
	a quantum supercavity can be formed by these two frequency-tunable
	cavities. We also study how to apply this photon transport control

	cylindrical fibers, CCC fibers are helical-translation symmetric,
	and, consequently, interaction between CCC fiber modes involves both
	spin and orbital angular momentum of the waves. Experimentally this
	has been verified by observing a multitude of new phase-matching
	resonances in the transmitted super-continuum spectrum, and theoretically
	explained through modal theory developed in helical reference frame.
	This enables new degrees of freedom in controlling fiber modal properties.},

	dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to

	the undoped materials is the conventional ordered state. We discuss,
	within a simple mean-field theory, the effect of weak three-dimensional
	antiferromagnetic coupling and the role of an antisymmetric term,
	introduced to explain a hidden ferromagnetic behavior of the uniform

	In the mean field approximation, we determine the free energy of

  abstract = {Above a critical power threshold for a given pulse width, a short
	pulse of coherent traveling-wave optical radiation is observed to
	propagate with anomalously low energy loss while at resonance with
	a two-quantum-level system of absorbers. The line shape of the resonant
	system is determined by inhomogeneous broadening, and the pulse width
	is short compared to dissipative relaxation times. A new mechanism
	of self-induced transparency, which accounts for the low energy loss,
	is analyzed in the ideal limit of a plane wave which excites a resonant
	medium with no damping present. The stable condition of transparency
	results after the traversal of the pulse through a few classical
	absorption lengths into the medium. This condition exists when the
	initial pulse has evolved into a symmetric hyperbolic-secant pulse
	function of time and distance, and has the area characteristic of
	a "2$\pi$ pulse." Ideal transparency then persists when coherent
	induced absorption of pulse energy during the first half of the pulse
	is followed by coherent induced emission of the same amount of energy
	back into the beam direction during the second half of the pulse.
	The effects of dissipative relaxation times upon pulse energy, pulse
	area, and pulse delay time are analyzed to first order in the ratio
	of short pulse width to long damping time. The analysis shows that
	the 2$\pi$ pulse condition can be maintained if losses caused by
	damping are compensated by beam focusing. In an amplifying inhomogeneously
	broadened medium an analytic "$\pi$ pulse area" solution is presented
	in the limit of a sharp leading edge of the pulse. The dynamics of
	self-induced transparency are studied for the particular effects
	of Doppler velocities upon a resonant gas. The analysis of transparency
	for random orientations of dipole moments associated with degenerate
	rotational states yields modified forms of self-induced transparency
	behavior, which indicates a finite pulse energy loss as a function
	of distance in some cases. The effect of self-induced transparency
	on the photon echo is considered. Experimental observations of self-induced
	transparency have been made in a ruby sample at resonance with a
	pulsed ruby-laser beam. Single and multiple 2$\pi$ pulse outputs
	have been observed, and pulse areas measured in the range of 2$\pi$.
	The experimental results are compared with the predictions of the
	ideal-plane-wave theory. Deviations from the ideal-plane-wave theory
	are discussed. An analysis is made of the effect of a transverse
	mode of the propagating beam upon the transparency properties of
	the pulse.},

  abstract = {This paper is divided into three disconnected parts. (i) An identity
	is proved which establishes an intimate connection between the statistical
	behavior of eigenvalues of random unitary matrices over the real
	field and over the quaternion field. It is proved that the joint
	distribution function of all the of a r!"ndom unitary matrix of order
	N is identical with the joint dlStnbutIOn functIOn of a set of N
	alternate eIgenvalues of a random unitary symmetric matrix of order
	2N. A corollary of this result is the following: the distribution
	of spacings between eigenvalues in a real symmetric matrix of large
	order is identical with the distribution of spacings in a self-dual
	Hennitian quaternion matrix of large order. (ii) A conjecture is
	made which gives an exact analytic fonnula for the partition function
	of a finite gas of N point charges free to move on an infinite straight
	line under the influence of an external harmonic potential. This
	conjecture is at the same time a statement about the statistical
	properties of the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices whose elements
	are Gaussian random variables. (iii) A list is made of several other
	problems which remain unsolved in the statistical theory of eigenvalues
	of random matrices.},

	stems from two decisive advancements. The first is the invention
	of reliable protocols for the manipulation of single atoms. The second
	is the ability to produce desired bosonic environments on demand.
	This progress has led to the possibility of controlling the form
	of the coupling between individual atoms and an arbitrary number
	of bosonic modes. As a consequence, fundamental matter-radiation
	interaction models, for instance, the Jaynes-Cummings model and most
	of its numerous nonlinear multiphoton generalizations, have been

	the state of the art of the theoretical investigations and of the

	the course of the paper we show that such a configuration provides

	and trapped ion experimental realms. In particular we discuss a mode-mode
	correlation effect appearing in the dynamics of a two-level atom

	electron spin at a given lattice point; or in a substitutional binary
	alloy $\alpha$ might denote which of the two possible kinds of atoms
	are at a given lattice point) can be found from the factor of the
	partition function which averages over all possible configurations

	the largest characteristic value of a linear homogeneous operator
	equation involving the potential energy between two adjacent layers
	of lattice points in the solid. By assuming that all possible configurations

	intermediate temperatures a theory of resonance between the low temperature
	``almost ordered'' characteristic vectors and the high temperature
	``almost disordered'' characteristic vectors is developed. In cases
	where the operator equation can be solved for microcrystals a few
	layers thick, a perturbation method is discussed in which interactions
	between the individual microcrystals are treated as perturbations.
	Some remarks are made concerning phase transitions and finally the

	coincides with the support of the discrete Stieltjes integral measure
	in the orthogonality relations of recently introduced orthogonal
	polynomials. The exactly solvable limit of the Rabi model corresponding
	to Δ=ω0/(2ωc)=0, which describes a displaced harmonic oscillator,
	is characterized by the discrete Charlier polynomials in normalized
	energy ϵ, which are orthogonal on an equidistant lattice. A non-zero
	value of Δ leads to non-classical discrete orthogonal polynomials
	ϕk(ϵ) and induces a deformation of the underlying equidistant lattice.
	The results provide a basis for a novel analytic method of solving
	the Rabi model. The number of ca. 1350 calculable energy levels per
	parity subspace obtained in double precision (cca 16 digits) by an
	elementary stepping algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude higher

	of the Rabi model arranged in increasing order can be determined
	as zeros of ϕN(ϵ) of at least the degree N=n+nt. The value of nt>0,
	which is slowly increasing with n, depends on the required precision.
	For instance, nt≃26 for n=1000 and dimensionless interaction constant
	κ=0.2, if double precision is required. Given that the sequence of
	the lth zeros xnl’s of ϕn(ϵ)’s defines a monotonically decreasing
	discrete flow with increasing n, the Rabi model is indistinguishable
	from an algebraically solvable model in any finite precision. Although
	we can rigorously prove our results only for dimensionless interaction
	constant κ<1, numerics and exactly solvable example suggest that
	the main conclusions remain to be valid also for κ≥1.},

	transitions, with quantized cavity radiation, in the framework of
	a lossless micromaser theory. Taking advantage of the fact that tthe
	atomic inversion is quasiregular in time in this model, with quite
	precise revivals, we find a very strong amplification of the average
	photon number. At the two-photon revival time, the atom leeaves the
	cavity in an almost pure state. This leads to an essentially noise-free
	process that results in a shift of two photons of the initial photon
	distribution each time an atom pases through the cavity, while the
	width of the photon distribution remains constat. This leads to strongly
	sub-Poissonian field statistics.},

  pages = {229 - 261},
  abstract = {Trapped ions are considered one of the best candidates to perform
	quantum information processing. By interacting them with laser beams
	they are, somehow, easy to manipulate, which makes them an excellent
	choice for the production of nonclassical states of their vibrational
	motion, the reconstruction of quasiprobability distribution functions,
	the production of quantum gates, etc. However, most of these effects
	have been produced in the so-called low intensity regime, this is,
	when the Rabi frequency (laser intensity) is much smaller than the
	trap frequency. Because of the possibility to produce faster quantum
	gates in other regimes it is of importance to study this system in
	a more complete manner, which is the motivation for this contribution.
	We start by studying the way ions are trapped in Paul traps and review
	the basic mechanisms of trapping. Then we show how the problem may
	be completely solved for trapping states; i.e., we find (exact) eigenstates
	of the full Hamiltonian. We show how, in the low intensity regime,
	Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings interactions may be obtained,
	without using the rotating wave approximation and analyze the medium
	and high intensity regimes where dispersive Hamiltonians are produced.
	The traditional approach (low intensity regime) is also studied and
	used for the generation of non-classical states of the vibrational
	wavefunction. In particular, we show how to add and subtract vibrational
	quanta to an initial state, how to produce specific superpositions
	of number states and how to generate NOON states for the two-dimensional
	vibration of the ion. It is also shown how squeezing may be measured.
	The time dependent problem is studied by using Lewis-Ermakov methods.
	We give a solution to the problem when the time dependence of the
	trap is considered and also analyze a specific (artificial) time
	dependence that produces squeezing of the initial vibrational wave
	function. A way to mimic the ion-laser interaction via classical
	optics is also introduced.},

	negligible insertion loss over C+L bands and modal cross talk better
	than −40 dB for any polarization state. Mode multiplexing is achieved
	by adiabatic transition from the fundamental mode of the single-mode

	In the regime with Ω0 comparable with the two-level transition frequency,
	'superradiant' quantum phase transitions for the cavity vacuum have
	been predicted, for example, within the Dicke model. In this study,
	we prove that if the time-independent light-matter Hamiltonian is

	electric dipole atomic transitions because of the oscillator strength
	sum rule. In circuit QED, the analogous of the electric dipole coupling

	by Cooper pair boxes capacitively coupled to a resonator, because
	of their peculiar Hilbert space topology and a violation of the corresponding

  title = {Phase saddles in light beams},
  journal = {J. Opt.},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {13},
  pages = {075709},
  abstract = {In a section through a monochromatic light beam the contour map of
	phase contains saddle points. It has already been shown that a two-dimensional
	model of two superposed coaxial Gaussian beams, in antiphase and
	having different waist sizes, contains two saddles that perform an
	elaborate dance as the ratio of the amplitudes of the beams is altered.
	The present paper explains why this choreography is qualitatively
	identical to that found in a symmetrical version of an earlier and
	simpler two-dimensional model, where a plane wave is modulated by
	a quadratic polynomial. If wavefronts are defined as lines of equal
	phase, successive wavefronts pinch together in these models, and
	change their connectedness as they pass through two fixed saddle
	points on the axis. Although the idea of a phase saddle is not generally
	applicable in three dimensions, it can be extended to three dimensions
	in axially symmetric models, for example, two superposed coaxial
	Gaussian beams. The saddles are features of the set of azimuthal
	planes, and can either form rings around the axis or be on the axis
	itself. The action here as a parameter changes takes a more dramatic
	form, because it involves both a vortex ring and two saddle points
	on the axis, which collide and explode into a concentric saddle ring.
	The physical significance of saddles is that they change the topology
	of the wavefronts. In two dimensions a moving wavefront line passing
	through a fixed saddle point on the axis undergoes reconnection.
	As it meets an off-axis saddle the same process occurs but in a different
	orientation. In three dimensions as a wavefront passes through a
	saddle point on the axis, its local form changes from a hyperboloid
	of two sheets to a hyperboloid of one sheet, or vice versa, via a
	cone of angle 2 tan-1 â 2 = 109â¦. As it passes through a saddle
	ring a similar transition occurs simultaneously at all points of
	the ring. The changes in the topology of a wavefront as it encounters
	a monkey saddle are also interesting. The behaviour of the saddle
	points and rings in two superposed three-dimensional Gaussian beams
	is also similar to that found in a simpler quadratic polynomial model.},

	light sources with reduced noise in the intensity, capable of producing
	photons one by one at given times1. However, the light field emitted
	by a single atom can exhibit much richer dynamics. A prominent example2,3
	is the predicted ability of a single atom to produce quadrature-squeezed
	light4, which has fluctuations of amplitude or phase that are below
	the shot-noise level. However, such squeezing is much more difficult
	to observe than the emission of single photons5. Squeezed beams have
	been generated using macroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few
	tens of atoms6, but despite experimental efforts7â9, single-atom
	squeezing has so far escaped observation. Here we generate squeezed
	light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical resonator. The
	strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a genuine
	quantum mechanical nonlinearity10, which is several orders of magnitude
	larger than in typical macroscopic media11â13. This produces observable
	quadrature squeezing14â16, with an excitation beam containing on
	average only two photons per system lifetime. In sharp contrast to
	the emission of single photons17, the squeezed light stems from the
	quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system18. The
	ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between
	propagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum
	logic with single emitters},

  abstract = {The transition from quantum to classical, in the case of a quantum
	harmonic oscillator, is typically identified with the transition
	from a quantum superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states,
	such as the Schrodinger-cat state, into the corresponding statistical
	mixture. This transition is commonly characterized by the asymptotic
	loss of the interference term in the Wigner representation of the
	cat state. In this paper we show that the quantum-to-classical transition
	has different dynamical features depending on the measure for nonclassicality
	used. Measures based on an operatorial definition have well-defined
	physical meaning and allow a deeper understanding of the quantum-to-classical
	transition. Our analysis shows that, for most nonclassicality measures,
	the Schrodinger-cat state becomes classical after a finite time.
	Moreover, our results challenge the prevailing idea that more macroscopic
	states are more susceptible to decoherence in the sense that the
	transition from quantum to classical occurs faster. Since nonclassicality
	is a prerequisite for entanglement generation our results also bridge
	the gap between decoherence, which is lost only asymptotically, and
	entanglement, which may show a "sudden death." In fact, whereas the
	loss of coherences still remains asymptotic, we emphasize that the
	transition from quantum to classical can indeed occur at a finite

  abstract = {Strongly correlated quantum systems are among the most intriguing
	and fundamental systems in physics. One such example is the TonksâGirardeau
	gas1,2, proposed about 40 years ago, but until now lacking experimental
	realization; in such a gas, the repulsive interactions between bosonic
	particles confined to one dimension dominate the physics of the system.
	In order to minimize their mutual repulsion, the bosons are prevented
	from occupying the same position in space. This mimics the Pauli
	exclusion principle for fermions, causing the bosonic particles to
	exhibit fermionic properties1,2.However, such bosons do not exhibit
	completely ideal fermionic (or bosonic) quantum behaviour; for example,
	this is reflected in their characteristic momentum distribution3.
	Here we report the preparation of a TonksâGirardeau gas of ultracold
	rubidium atoms held in a twodimensional optical lattice formed by
	two orthogonal standing waves. The addition of a third, shallower
	lattice potential along the long axis of the quantum gases allows
	us to enter the Tonksâ Girardeau regime by increasing the atomsâ
	effective mass and thereby enhancing the role of interactions.We
	make a theoretical prediction of the momentum distribution based
	on an approach in which trapped bosons acquire fermionic properties,
	finding that it agrees closely with the measured distribution.},

	The spectrum of the real bosonic system is identical to the one of

  abstract = {The usual mathematical model of the single-mode electromagnetic field
	is the harmonic oscillator with an infinite-dimensional state space,
	which unfortunately cannot accommodate the existence of a Hermitian
	phase operator. Recently we indicated that this difficulty may be
	circumvented by using an alternative, and physically indistinguishable,
	mathematical model of the ingle-mode field involving a finite but
	arbitrarily large state space, the dimension of which is allowed
	to tend to infinity after physically tneasurable results, such as
	expectation values, are calculated. In this paper we investigate
	the properties of a Hermitian phase operator which follows directly
	and uniquely from the form of the phase states in this space and
	find them to be well behaved. The phase-number commutator is not
	subject to the difficulties inherent in Dirac's original commutator,
	but still preserves the commutator —Poisson-bracket correspondence
	for physical field states. In the quantum regime of small field strengths,
	the phase operator predicts phase properties substantially different
	from those obtained using the conventional Susskind-Glogower operators.
	In particular, our results are consistent with the vacuum being a
	state of random phase and the phases of two vacuum fields being uncorrelated.
	For higher-intensity fields, the quantum phase properties agree with
	those previously obtained by phenomenological and semiclassical approaches,
	where such approximations are valid. We illustrate the properties
	of the phase with a discussion of partial phase states. The Hermitian
	phase operator also allows us to construct a unitary number-shift
	operator and phase-moment generating functions. We conclude that
	the alternative mathematical description of the single-mode field
	presented here provides a valid, and potentially useful, quantum-mechanical
	approach for calculating the phase properties of the electromagnetic

	by adjusting the distribution factor χ0 of the beams. It is notable
	that the various propagation directions of the beams can be obtained
	by changing the phase, at the same situation, when the interval of
	the two beams becomes narrower, the phase plays an important role
	of controlling the direction of the accelerated spot.},

	by utilizing the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm
	to variationally minimize an infinite matrix product state (MPS)
	parameterized by a matrix size $\chi$ . Exploiting the direct restriction
	on the half-chain entanglement imposed by fixing $\chi$ , we determined
	that reentrance in the MI lobes only emerges in this approximation
	when $\chi$ 8. This entanglement threshold is found to be coincident
	with the ability of an infinite MPS to be simultaneously particle-number
	symmetric and capture the kinetic energy carried by particle-hole
	excitations above the MI. Focusing on the tip of the MI lobe, we
	then applied a general finite-entanglement scaling analysis of the
	infinite-order Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) critical point located there.
	By analyzing values of $\chi$ up to a very moderate $\chi$ = 70,
	we obtained an estimate of the KT transition as tKT = 0.30 ± 0.01,
	demonstrating how a finite-entanglement approach can provide not
	only qualitative insight but also quantitatively accurate predictions.},

	Among these are Hamiltonians respecting parity–time (PT) symmetry2–7.
	Even though the Hermiticity of quantum observableswas never in doubt,
	such concepts have motivated discussions on several fronts in physics,

	robustness akin to that of superconductors. Topological insulators
	are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant
	quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been directed
	towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves4,
	5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. One-dimensional systems with topological
	edge states have been demonstrated, but these states are zero-dimensional
	and therefore exhibit no transport properties11, 12, 14. Topological
	protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar
	to the quantum Hall effect15, by placing a gyromagnetic photonic
	crystal in an external magnetic field5. But because magnetic effects
	are very weak at optical frequencies, realizing photonic topological

	systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose and experimentally
	demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external fields

	topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice
	edges. Our system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled
	helical waveguides20 arranged in a graphene-like honeycomb lattice21,
	22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Paraxial diffraction of light is described by
	a Schrödinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) acts

	symmetry as proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure
	results in one-way edge states that are topologically protected from

  abstract = {The interaction of a two-level atom with a single-mode quantized field
	is one of the simplest models in quantum optics. Under
	
	the rotating wave approximation, it is known as the Jaynes-Cummings
	model and without it as the Rabi model. Real-world realizations of
	the Jaynes-Cummings model include cavity, ion trap and circuit quantum
	electrodynamics. The Rabi model can be realized in circuit quantum
	electrodynamics. As soon as nonlinear couplings are introduced, feasible
	experimental realizations in quantum systems are drastically reduced.
	We propose a set of two photonic lattices that classically simulates
	the interaction of a single two-level system with a quantized field
	under field nonlinearities and nonlinear couplings as long as the
	quantum optics
	
	model conserves parity. We describe how to reconstruct the mean value
	of quantum optics measurements, such as photon number and atomic
	energy excitation, from the intensity and from the field, such as
	von Neumann entropy and fidelity, at the output of the photonic lattices.
	We discuss how typical initial states involving coherent or displaced
	Fock fields can be engineered from recently discussed Glauber-Fock
	lattices. As an example, the Buck-Sukumar model, where the coupling
	depends on the intensity
	
	of the field, is classically simulated for separable and entangled
	initial states.},

  abstract = {Using a time‐dependent variational method, we study the evolution
	of nonstationary states in Longuet‐Higgin’s model of a Jahn–Teller
	molecule. Conditions are found for the nuclear motion to be adiabatic.
	The effects of wave‐packet spreading are neglected upon specializing
	to the case of nearly harmonic motion. It is shown explicitly how
	the effective vector potential introduced by Mead and Truhlar gives
	rise to an electronic Berry phase. In a semiclassical approximation
	sufficient to produce the electronic adiabatic phase anticipated
	from the result for a given sequence of nuclear configurations, it
	is demonstrated that the effective vector potential has a negligible
	effect on the nuclear motion; the effective vector potential, the
	source of an effective field proportional to ℏ, is seen to affect
	the nuclear trajectory only in higher order. For the special case
	of periodic nuclear motion the electronic adiabatic phase is seen
	as a contribution to the geometric phase attending an arbitrary cyclic
	evolution. It is demonstrated that a molecular state prepared with
	identically pseudorotating nuclear wave packets in both electronic
	levels corresponds, in a weak coupling limit, to a spin 1/2 in a
	conically varying external field. Geometrical phase differences are
	shown to make discernible contributions to the frequencies of oscillation
	of the electronic charge and current densities, which may serve as
	classical sources for superradiant emission. Our results are shown
	to be gauge invariant.},

	In this regard, the question arises of whether quantum dot (QD) systems

	to be considered as coupled quantum systems. Here, we present experimental
	evidence for a long-range electromagnetic interaction between laterally

	behave like independent objects as long as they form an ensemble
	of QDs. By removing QDs from the sample, we found that the coupling

	which can be transformed into a real nonlinear Ermakov equation.
	The coupled pair of these equations yields a dynamical invariant
	which plays a key role in our investigation. It can be expressed
	in terms of a complex variable that linearizes the Riccati equation.
	This variable also provides the time-dependent parameters that characterize

	From there, also the relation between the classical and quantum dynamics

	Factorization of the dynamical invariant allows for comparison with
	creation/annihilation operators and supersymmetry where the partner

	quantum bit (qubit) to signals on a microwave transmission line, it

  abstract = {One of the most interesting phenomena in solid-state physics is Anderson
	localization, which predicts that an electron may become immobile
	when placed in a disordered lattice1. The origin of localization
	is interference between multiple scatterings of the electron by random
	defects in the potential, altering the eigenmodes from being extended
	(Bloch waves) to exponentially localized2. As a result, the material
	is transformed from a conductor to an insulator. Andersonâs work
	dates back to 1958, yet strong localization has never been observed
	in atomic crystals, because localization occurs only if the potential
	(the periodic lattice and the fluctuations superimposed on it) is
	time-independent. However, in atomic crystals important deviations
	from the Anderson model always occur, because of thermally excited
	phonons and electronâelectron interactions. Realizing that Anderson
	localization is a wave phenomenon relying on interference, these
	concepts were extended to optics3,4. Indeed, both weak5â7,31 and
	strong8â11 localization effects were experimentally demonstrated,
	traditionally by studying the transmission properties of randomly
	distributed optical scatterers (typically suspensions or powders
	of dielectric materials). However, in these studies the potential
	was fully random, rather than being âfrozenâ fluctuations on
	a periodic potential, as the Anderson model assumes. Here we report
	the experimental observation of Anderson localization in a perturbed
	periodic potential: the transverse localization of light caused by
	random fluctuations on a two-dimensional photonic lattice. We demonstrate
	how ballistic transport becomes diffusive in the presence of disorder,
	and that crossover to Anderson localization occurs at a higher level
	of disorder. Finally, we study how nonlinearities affect Anderson
	localization. As Anderson localization is a universal phenomenon,
	the ideas presented here could also be implemented in other systems
	(for example, matter waves), thereby making it feasible to explore
	experimentally long-sought fundamental concepts, and bringing up
	a variety of intriguing questions related to the interplay between
	disorder and nonlinearity.},

	the dependence of this enhancement on the properties of a specific

	the classical aspects of spontaneous emission and to reveal the existence
	of Rabi oscillations in atomic excitation probabilities for fields
	with sharply defined energy (or photon number) . For fields having
	a statistical distributions of photon numbers the oscillations collapse
	to an expected steady value . In 1980 it was discovered that with
	appropriate initial conditions (e .g . a near-classical field), the
	Rabi oscillations would eventually revive, only to collapse and revive
	repeatedly in a complicated pattern . The existence of these revivals,
	present in the analytic solutions of the JCM, provided direct evidence
	for discreteness of field excitation (photons) and hence for the
	truly quantum nature of radiation . Subsequent study revealed further
	non-classical properties of the JCM field, such as a tendency of
	the photons to antibunch . Within the last two years it has been
	found that during the quiescent intervals of collapsed Rabi oscillations
	the atom and field exist in a macroscopic superposition state (a
	Schrodinger cat) . This discovery offers the opportunity to use the
	JCM to elucidate the basic properties of quantum correlation (entanglement)
	and to explore still further the relationship between classical and
	quantum physics . The relative simplicity of the JCM and the ease
	with which it can be extended through analytic expressions or numerical
	computation . continues to motivate attention, as evidenced by the
	growing abundance of publications . We here present an overview of

	We study two specific atomic separations which give rise to symmetric
	atomâfield couplings. For general atomic distances, we consider
	a subset of initial states analytically, and then treat the more
	general situation numerically. We examine a variety of qualitative
	features such as entanglement sudden death, dynamical generation,
	protection and transfer between subsystems. Our analysis shows a
	stark contrast in features of entanglement between the two special
	coupling schemes often considered; further, these features are uncharacteristic
	of those arising for general distances, due to the high degree of
	symmetry present in the special cases. The variety of behaviours
	in these two-mode cases suggests the importance of considering atomic
	separation carefully for any model where two atoms interact with
	a common field.},

	(qubit) of light is essential for long-distance quantum communication,

	optical quantum memory must be able to receive and recreate the photonic
	qubit; additionally, it must store an unknown quantum state of light
	better than any classical device. So far, these two requirements
	have been met only by ensembles of material particles that store
	the information in collective excitations2-7. Recent developments,
	however, have paved the way for an approach in which the information
	exchange occurs between single quanta of light and matter8-13. This
	single-particle approach allows the material qubit to be addressed,
	which has fundamental advantages for realistic implementations. First,
	it enables a heralding mechanism that signals the successful storage
	of a photon by means of state detection14-16; this can be used to
	combat inevitable losses and finite efficiencies. Second, it allows
	for individual qubit manipulations, opening up avenues for in situ

	in resonant interaction with atoms. At present the main application
	is laser cooling, but the approach is applicable to a broader range
	of phenomena. It is based on an adiabatic eliminination philosophy,
	which turns out to give the lowest-order quantum corrections to the
	behavior found when the photon momentum goes to zero. hence it is
	called a semiclassical theory. In this manner a subjective but consistent
	approach can be presented; other treatments are incorporated or mentioned
	at the appropriate places. Both the classical and the quantum-mechanical
	approach are discussed. Those readers who wish to obtain only a heuristic
	overview of the phenomena can concentrate on Sec. III, which treats
	both the photon momentum effects and their connection with photon
	counting statistics. The detailed theoretical treatment utilizes
	Wigner functions and Fokker-Planck techniques. The ensuing theory
	is applied both to the cooling of free particles and trapped ones.
	The paper ends with an extensive bibliography, where the author lists

	quantum communication and computation2–5. Photons are an optimal
	choice for carrying information in the form of ‘flying qubits’, but
	the teleportation of photonic quantum bits6–11 (qubits) has been
	limited by experimental inefficiencies and restrictions. Main disadvantages
	include the fundamentally probabilistic nature of linearoptics Bell

	qubit or attenuate the input qubit when the detectors do not resolve
	photon numbers13. Here we experimentally realize fully deterministic
	quantum teleportation of photonic qubitswithout postselection. The
	key step is to make use of a hybrid technique involving continuous-variable
	teleportation14–16of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit. When the
	receiver’s feedforward gain is optimally tu ned, the continuous-variable
	teleporter acts as a pure loss channel17,18 , and theinput dual-rail-encoded
	qubit, based on a single photon, represents a quantum error detection
	code against photon loss19 and hence
	
	remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows
	for a faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect continuous-variable
	entangled states: for four qubits the overall transfer fidelities
	range from 0.79 to 0.82 and all of them exceed the classical limit
	of teleportation. Furthermore, even for a relatively low level of
	the entanglement, qubits are teleported much more efficiently than
	in previous experiments, albeit post-selectively (taking into account

	down to the nanoscale. Less attention has been paid to going the
	other way, trapping increasingly large particles. Optical tweezers
	typically employ a single laser beam tightly focused by a microscope
	objective of high numerical aperture to stably trap a particle in
	three dimensions (3D). As the particle size increases, stable 3D
	trapping in a single-beam trap requires scaling up the optical power,

	the use of high NA objectives, is particularly unfavorable for catching

  abstract = {Progress in the reliable preparation, coherent propagation and efficient
	detection of many-body states has recently brought collective quantum
	phenomena of many identical particles into the spotlight. This tutorial
	introduces the physics of many-boson and many-fermion interference
	required for the description of current experiments and for the understanding
	of novel approaches to quantum computing.
	
	
	The field is motivated via the two-particle case, for which the uncorrelated,
	classical dynamics of distinguishable particles is compared to the
	quantum behaviour of identical bosons and fermions. Bunching of bosons
	is opposed to anti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute
	equivalent sources of bipartite two-level entanglement. The realms
	of indistinguishable and distinguishable particles are connected
	by a monotonic transition, on a scale defined by the coherence length
	of the interfering particles.
	
	
	As we move to larger systems, any attempt to understand many particles
	via the two-particle paradigm fails: in contrast to two-particle
	bunching and anti-bunching, the very same signatures can be exhibited
	by bosons and fermions, and coherent effects dominate over statistical
	behaviour. The simulation of many-boson interference, termed boson-sampling,
	entails a qualitatively superior computational complexity when compared
	to fermions. The problem can be tamed by an artificially designed
	symmetric instance, which allows a systematic understanding of coherent
	bosonic and fermionic signatures for arbitrarily large particle numbers,
	and a means to stringently assess many-particle interference. The
	hierarchy between bosons and fermions also characterizes multipartite
	entanglement generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch
	fermions. Finally, the quantum-to-classical transition between many
	indistinguishable and many distinguishable particles features non-monotonic
	structures, which dismisses the single-particle coherence length
	as unique indicator for interference capability. While the same physical
	principles govern small and large systems, the deployment of the
	intrinsic complexity of collective many-body interference makes more
	particles behave differently.},

	reveals number squeezing of the initial superfluid state. To describe
	the dynamics, we use an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the

	analysis of both the multiband, nonstationary dynamics in the final
	deep lattice and the number squeezing of the initial superfluid state
	explains important characteristics of optical lattice collapse and
	revival physics. Finally, by treating the two- and three-body interaction
	strengths and the coefficients describing the initial superposition
	of number states as free parameters in a fit to the experimental

	of the electron flow through these structures have so far not been
	clarified. However, it has recently become possible to image current
	directly through 2DEG devices using scanning probe microscope techniques3â13.
	Here, we use such a technique to observe electron flow through a
	narrow constriction in a 2DEGâa quantum point contact. The images
	show that the electron flow from the point contact forms narrow,
	branching strands instead of smoothly spreading fans. Our theoretical
	study of this flow indicates that this branching of current flux
	is due to focusing of the electron paths by ripples in the background
	potential. The strands are decorated by interference fringes separated
	by half the Fermi wavelength, indicating the persistence of quantum
	mechanical phase coherence in the electron flow. These findings may
	have important implications for a better understanding of electron
	transport in 2DEGs and for the design of future nanostructure devices.},

	within the context of the free-space paraxial propagation, formally
	accounted for by the 2D paraxial wave equation. In particular, the
	Appell transformation, which is well known in the theory of the heat
	equation, is reformulated in optical terms, and accordingly interpreted
	in the light of the propagation of given source functions, which
	are in a definite relation with the source functions of the original
	wavefunctions. Basic to the discussion is the Lie-algebra-based approach,
	as developed in a series of seminal papers by Kalnins, Miller and
	Boyer, to evolutionary-type equations, ruled by Hamiltonian operators
	underlying a harmonic oscillator-like symmetry algebra. Indeed, both
	the heat equation and the paraxial wave equation are particular cases
	of this kind of equation. When interpreting such an approach in terms
	of the propagation of assigned âsourceâ functions, the transformations
	between wavefunctions may be traced back to definite relations between
	the respective source functions. Thus, the optical Appell transformation
	is seen to be a manifestation of the correspondence between wavefunctions
	generated by eigenstates of operators, which are linked through a
	Fourier-similarity transformation. As a mere consequence, one can
	introduce the fractional Appell transformation, thus displaying a
	family of symmetry transformations parameterized by a continuous
	parameter.},

	for the so-called heavy-fermion and related systems such as the Kondo
	insulators. In this review we summarize recent progress in the understanding
	of these models, in particular, the one-dimensional Kondo lattice
	model. The ground-state phase diagram for the one-dimensional Kondo
	lattice model is determined and shows three distinct phases: a ferromagnetic
	metallic, an insulating spin liquid, and a paramagnetic metallic
	state. We present results on these phases obtained from rigorous
	and approximate analytical calculations supported by various extensive
	numerical studies on finite-size systems. The ferromagnetic phase
	appears in the limit of low density of conduction electrons and for
	strong Kondo coupling away from half filling. On the other hand,
	the half-filled Kondo lattice has a gap in both spin and charge excitations,
	i.e., it has a spin-liquid ground state. The paramagnetic phase may
	be considered as the generic heavy-fermion state and appears in the
	weak-coupling limit away from half filling. While the former two
	phases are well understood, the physics of the paramagnetic phase
	is not worked out in detail yet. In this context various questions
	will be considered here: Does the Fermi surface include conduction
	electrons only or also the localized electrons? Does the concept
	of Luttinger liquid apply in this case? The extension of these results
	to higher dimensions is also discussed. It is important to notice
	that the ground states of the Kondo lattice and the periodic Anderson

	simple extension of the single- or two-impurity problem.},

	“no-go theorem” asserts that the so-called A2

	of states for classical statistical models. The density of states
	is modiﬁed at each step when the energy level is visited to produce
	a ﬂat histogram. By carefully controlling the modiﬁcation factor,
	we allow the density of states to converge to the true value very
	quickly, even for large systems. From the density of states at the
	end of the random walk, we can estimate thermodynamic quantities
	such as internal energy and speciﬁc heat capacity by calculating
	canonical averages at any temperature. Using this method, we not
	only can avoid repeating simulations at multiple temperatures, but
	we can also estimate the free energy and entropy, quantities that
	are not directly accessible by conventional Monte Carlo simulations.
	This algorithm is especially useful for complex systems with a rough
	landscape since all possible energy levels are visited with the same
	probability. As with the multicanonical Monte Carlo technique, our
	method overcomes the tunneling barrier between coexisting phases
	at ﬁrst-order phase transitions. In this paper, we apply our algorithm
	to both ﬁrst- and second-order phase transitions to demonstrate its
	efﬁciency and accuracy. We obtained direct simulational estimates
	for the density of states for two-dimensional ten-state Potts models
	on lattices up to 2003200 and Ising models on lattices up to 2563256.
	Our simulational results are compared to both exact solutions and
	existing numerical data obtained using other methods. Applying this
	approach to a threedimensional 6J spin-glass model, we estimate the
	internal energy and entropy at zero temperature; and, using a two-dimensional
	random walk in energy and order-parameter space, we obtain the ~rough!
	canonical distribution and energy landscape in order-parameter space.
	Preliminary data suggest that the glass transition temperature is
	about 1.2 and that better estimates can be obtained with more extensive
	application of the method. This simulational method is not restricted
	to energy space and can be used to calculate the density of states
	for any parameter by a random walk in the corresponding space.},

	which to investigate fundamental properties of quantum many-body
	systems. In particular, the high degree of control of experimental
	parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such
	as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate
	how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level
	of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using
	a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we
	were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator
	with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing.
	The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array
	of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns
	by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing
	out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum
	dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line,
	and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional
	ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport
	and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of
	novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases
	and various quantum information processing applications.},

	is largely centered around a general closed formula for the derivative
	of an exponential operator with respect to a parameter. Derivations
	are given of the Baker‐Campbell‐Hausdorff formula and its dual, the
	Zassenhaus formula. The continuous analogs of these formulas which
	solve the differential equationdY(t)/dt = A(t) Y(t), the solutions
	of Magnus and Fer, respectively, are similarly derived in a recursive
	manner which manifestly displays the general repeated commutator
	nature of these expansions and which is quite suitable for computer
	programming. An expansion recently obtained by Kumar and another
	new expansion are shown to be derivable from the Fer and Magnus solutions,
	respectively, in the same way. Useful similarity transformations
	involving linear combinations of elements of a Lie algebra are obtained.
	Some cases where the product eAeB can be written as a closed form
	single exponential are considered which generalize results of Sack
	and of Weiss and Maradudin. Closed form single exponential solutions
	to the differential equationdY(t)/dt = A(t) Y(t) are obtained for
	two cases and compared with the corresponding multiple exponential
	solutions of Wei and Norman. Normal ordering of operators is also
	treated and derivations, corollaries, or generalization of a number
	of known results are efficiently obtained. Higher derivatives of
	exponential and general operators are discussed by means of a formula
	due to Poincaré which is the operator analog of the Cauchy integral
	formula of complex variable theory. It is shown how results obtained
	by Aizu for matrix elements and traces of derivatives may be readily
	derived from the Poincaré formula. Some applications of the results
	of this paper to quantum statistics and to the Weyl prescription
	for converting a classical function to a quantum operator are given.
	A corollary to a theorem of Bloch is obtained which permits one to
	obtain harmonic oscillator canonical‐ensemble averages of general
	operators defined by the Weyl prescription. Solutions of the density
	matrix equation are also discussed. It is shown that an initially
	canonical ensemble behaves as though its temperature remains constant

  abstract = {I t is shown that the rotating wave approximation in the minimal coupling
	Hamiltonian with the A2 term leads to an incorrect energy spectrum
	of the polariton mode: in particular, to a spurious polariton instability
	which should not occur for a photon-matter system consisting of radiation
	and atoms without the Coulomb interaction. Thus the counter-rotating
	term in the presence of the Aâ term plays a crucial role in the
	instability property of the system. The super-radiant phase transition
	in the Dicke model is shown to be accompanied by polariton instability,
	and therefore by instability of the ground state of the photon-matter
	system. The rotating wave approximation, as well as the neglect of
	the A 2 term, should therefore nor be made for the study of the thermodynamic
	phase transition and instability properties of the ground state of
	the system. 1. Introduction In general, a truncated Hamiltonian gives
	an approximate energy spectrum and an approximate equation of motion
	which differs from the original correct one. Therefore its validity
	is limited to particular usage. In quantum optics, the counter-rotating
	term, the A2 term and the P term are often truncated in the basic
	Hamiltonian in order to â simplify the calculation. If the A2term
	is omitted, however, the resulting field equation for the vector
	potential A(r, t ) contains an extra term which makes the state A
	= 0 unstable (Yamanoi 1976).Similarly, if the P term in the dipole
	coupling Hamiltonian is â omitted, an extra term P ( t ) for polarisation
	is introduced in the equation of motion, making the state P = 0 unstable
	(Yamanoi and Takatsuji 1977). In other words, the consequence of
	these extra terms is to make the polariton mode with eigenfrequency
	w soft ( w + 0) and finally unstable ( w 2< 0) under some threshold
	condition (polariton instability). However, the above-mentioned instability
	does not represent the true dynamical property of the photon-matter
	system, because this is originated entirely in the truncation of
	the Aâ or the P term. â Since the polariton mode is a small oscillation
	of fields A and P about the state A = P = 0 (the ground state in
	which t h e photon is absent and all atoms are in their lowest states),
	the polariton instability means the instability of the ground state
	of the photon-matter system, indicating the appearance of a new ground
	state (A f 0, P f 0) with energy lower than the normal ground state
	(A = P = 0). Only when we consider a situation where each of these
	extra terms does not play any crucial role, we can use the approximate
	Hamiltonian without the Aâ or the P2 term to study electromagnetic
	phenomena which have nothing to do with the instability of the ground
	state of the photon-matter system.},

	lasers operating far above threshold, according to the self-consistent

	states, leads to applications not obtainable from coherent states

  abstract = {Many works are based on the steady-state analysis of mean-value dynamics
	in electro- or optomechanical systems to explore vibration cooling,
	squeezing, and quantum-state controlling of massive objects. These
	studies are always conducted in a red-detuned pumping field under
	a lower power to maintain a stable situation. In this paper we consider
	self-sustained oscillations of a cavity-field-driven oscillator combined
	with quadratic coupling in a blue-detuned regime above a pumping
	threshold. Our study finds that the oscillator will be far away from
	its steady-state behavior by conducting a self-sustained oscillation
	with a discrete amplitude locking effect producing a rich energy-balanced
	structure. The dynamical backaction of this self-oscillation on the
	field mode induces a multipeak field spectrum, which implies an efficient
	harmonic generation with its intensity modified not only by the displacement
	x0 but also by the amplitude A of the mechanical oscillation. The
	corresponding nonlinear field spectrum and its magnitude are analytically
	analyzed with quadratic coupling when the mechanical oscillator is
	dynamically locked to a self-sustained oscillation.},

	the European Commission for the preparation of the Seventh Framework
	Program. Besides being a document addressed to policy makers and
	funding agencies (both at the European and national level), the document
	contains a detailed scientific assessment of the state-of-the-art,
	main research goals, challenges, strengths, weaknesses, visions and
	perspectives of all the most relevant QIPC sub-fields, that we report
	here.  Dedicated to the memory of Prof. Th. Beth, one of the pioneers
	of QIPC, whose contributions have had a significant scientific impact
	on the development as well as on the visibility of a field that he
	enthusiastically helped to shape since its early days.},

	the dispersive couplings under the reasonable experimental parameters.
	In particular, in the limits of high temperature (T ) and high mechanical

  pages = {54 - 58},
  abstract = {Phase transitions are dramatic phenomena: water freezes into ice,
	atomic spins spontaneously align in a magnet, and liquid helium becomes
	superfluid. Sometimes, such a drastic change in behaviour is accompanied
	by a visible change in appearance. The hallmark of BoseâEinstein
	condensation and superfluidity in trapped, weakly interacting Bose
	gases is the sudden formation of a dense central core inside a thermal
	cloud1â7. However, in strongly interacting gasesâsuch as the
	recently observed fermionic superfluids8âthere is no longer a clear
	separation between the superfluid and the normal parts of the cloud.
	The detection of fermion pair condensates has required magnetic field
	sweeps9â11 into theweakly interacting regime, and the quantitative
	description of these sweeps presents a major theoretical challenge.
	Here we report the direct observation of the superfluid phase transition
	in a strongly interacting gas of 6Li fermions, through sudden changes
	in the shape of the cloudsâin complete analogy to the case of weakly
	interacting Bose gases. By preparing unequal mixtures of the two
	spin components involved in the pairing12,13, we greatly enhance
	the contrast between the superfluid core and the normal component.
	Furthermore, the distribution of non-interacting excess atoms serves
	as a direct and reliable thermometer. Even in the normal state, strong
	interactions significantly deform the density profile of the majority
	spin component. We show that it is these interactions that drive
	the normal-to-superfluid transition at the critical population imbalance
	of 70 6 5 per cent (ref. 12).},
